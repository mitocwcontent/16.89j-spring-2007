description: 'Assignment to map out the key relationships between angular resolution,
  signal to noise ratio and system cost for a telescope with a circular monolithic
  aperture at three wavelengths: radio frequency, infrared and visual. The purpose
  of this exercise is for you to obtain a better understanding the relationships between
  key aspects of the problem such as imaging performance in terms of isolation and
  sensitivity, system mass, system cost and location.'
